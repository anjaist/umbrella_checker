# umbrella_checker
A site that checks weather forecast and tells you if you should take an umbrella today or not.

Because I'm not using a custom domain, github will prevent the page from accessing the AccuWeather api ('Insecure content blocked')

<strong>In order for the site to work, <em>'Load unsafe content'</em> needs to be clicked.</strong>
